# 🎮 Playground: learn by building

This repository is organized around **project-based learning**. Theory lives here on `main`, while real implementations live on tech-specific branches.

### Branch Strategy

Branches are organized by technology. Each tech stack has a dedicated long-lived branch.

| Branch | Purpose |
| --- | ---  |
| `js` | JavaScript/TypeScript projects and experiments |
| `php` | PHP projects |
| `csharp` | .NET & C# projects |
| `[tech]` | More tech branches as needed |

**Rules for Tech Branches**
- Contain multiple small projects
- Each project focuses on one or more concepts
- Every project must include a README explaining
    - Goal (what you built and why: learning goals, concepts, patterns, etc.)
    - Mistakes
    - Results (metrics, screenshots, demo, etc.)
    - Resources (links to relevant docs, tutorials, etc.)
